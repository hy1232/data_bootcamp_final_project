This project will measure the increase in market cap of specific companies in their respective industries over the company age within the United States. For instance, comparing two companies like Apple and ExxonMobil, Apple was able to outpace the growth of ExxonMobil to become an industry leader and a relatively young age. The project will use data from Bloomberg to access the market cap of the company along with other details like share price, and revenue.

We plan to present 6 graphs with the average market cap of the industry along with the age of each company. A final graph comparing the top performers of each of the industries to compare the market cap with the age. We are using market capitalization to show the size of a company is important because company size is a basic determinant of various characteristics in which investors are interested, including risk.
